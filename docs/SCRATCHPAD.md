**Question:** Which embedding model would you recommend for the embdding of chess baord positions represented as FEN. I want to store these board positions in a RAG system snd execute a similarity search on them

which embedding model would you recommend for the embdding of chess baord positions represented as FEN. I want to store these board positions in a RAG system snd execute a similarity search on them don’t use a general text embedding model on raw FEN. You’ll get token-level artifacts that don’t reflect chess similarity. Use a purpose-built board encoder and (optionally) learn a small embedding head.

Here’s a practical, RAG-friendly stack that works well for chess positions:

### 1) Canonicalization & dedup (pre-embedding)

- **Normalize FEN**: drop halfmove/fullmove counters; keep side-to-move, castling, en-passant.
- **Symmetry canonicalization**: pick a canonical transform over {identity, flip ranks/files, rotate 180°} that makes equivalent patterns map to the same representative (e.g., always put the side-to-move as “White”, flip board if needed).
- **Hash**: store a Zobrist (or any 64-bit) hash of the canonical FEN for exact dedup and a unique key.

### 2) Baseline embedding (deterministic, zero-training)

**Bitboard one-hot → float vector**

- 12 piece planes × 64 squares = **768 dims** (binary 0/1).
- - side-to-move (1), castling rights (4 one-hots), en-passant file (9 one-hots incl. “none”) → **~782 dims total**.
- Store as float32 and use **cosine** distance.
   This already gives sensible “same/similar piece layouts ≈ close” behavior.

### 3) Motif-aware head (small, optionally trained)

If you care about *strategic* motifs (e.g., queenside majority), add a compact feature block and/or learn a projection:

- **Pawn-structure features (~40–60 dims)**
  - File counts: white pawns fA…fH (8), black pawns fA…fH (8).
  - Binary flags: isolated, doubled, backward, passed (per file, compressed counts).
  - Pawn-island count (white, black), open/semi-open files per side, majority indicators (queenside/kingside).
- **Material & king-safety lite (~10–20 dims)**
  - Material vector (piece counts per type), king files/ranks bucketed, castling availability.
- **Concatenate** with the 782-d baseline and (optionally) learn a **64–128-d projection** with a tiny MLP trained contrastively:
  - **Positives**: positions equal under symmetries; same pawn structure; small Stockfish eval delta; same ECO bucket in early middlegame.
  - **Negatives**: random positions; different pawn structures.

> [Unverified] In practice, this small learned head often outperforms raw one-hots for motif queries while staying cheap to compute.

### 4) Engine-informed enrichment (optional)

If you can batch-evaluate positions:

- Store **eval score**, **phase** (opening/middlegame/endgame), and a few **engine features** (e.g., mobility, passed pawns).
- Use them as **filters** or as extra dimensions (scaled); don’t force them into the core embedding if you worry about engine bias.

### 5) Vector-DB setup

- Use **cosine** or **dot-product** for dense floats.
- Keep two indexes:
  1. **layout index** = the 782-d (or projected 64–128-d) vector.
  2. **pawn-structure index** = a 32–64-d pawn-only vector (fast shortlist for structure-first searches).
- Store the **canonical FEN** + metadata (game id, move number, ECO, eval) alongside vectors.

### 6) Query patterns that work

- **“Queenside majority attack”**: search the **pawn-structure index** first (queenside majority flag + file counts), then re-rank with the layout index or engine eval proximity.
- **“Same piece placement / tactical pattern”**: hit the **layout index** directly.
- **Filters**: side-to-move, castling rights, eval window, phase, ECO.

### Why not a text embedding (OpenAI, bge, etc.) on FEN?

- FEN is a compact code, not natural language; tokenizers will slice it arbitrarily.
- Distance in token space doesn’t track **board** similarity.

> [Unverified] You may see occasional wins, but it’s brittle and hard to reason about.

------

#### Minimal implementation sketch (what to build first)

1. **Canonicalizer** (FEN ↔ board; symmetry normalize; strip clocks).
2. **Encoder**:
   - `float[782]` baseline vector (12×64 pieces + STM + castling + EP).
   - `float[?]` pawn-features vector (counts/flags).
3. **(Optional)** Tiny MLP to 128-d with contrastive training (you can start untrained and add this later).
4. **Two indexes** in your vector DB, plus scalar metadata columns for fast filtering.

If you want, I can generate a reference encoder (Python or OCaml) that outputs both the 782-d baseline and a 48-d pawn-structure vector, plus a Qdrant schema to store them.



Below is a self-contained OCaml reference encoder for chess positions in FEN.
 It produces:

- a **782-d baseline vector**: 12×64 one-hot piece planes (P,N,B,R,Q,K × white/black = 768) + side-to-move (1) + castling rights K,Q,k,q (4) + en-passant file one-hot (a–h, none = 9)
- a **48-d pawn/metadata vector** with file counts, islands, open/semi-open files, isolated/doubled/passed counts, side majorities, material counts, castling/STM/EP flags, and a crude “phase” scalar

No external deps. Keep or adapt the feature ordering as you need.
