{0 Chessmate Documentation}

Welcome to the Chessmate developer documentation. These guide pages complement
the API reference generated by odoc and highlight how the project is organised.

{1 Getting Started}

- Read `docs/handbook/ARCHITECTURE.md` for a visual overview of ingestion, embedding, and
  query flows.
- Follow `docs/handbook/DEVELOPER.md` to bootstrap the local environment and learn the
  repository conventions.

{1 Autogenerated API Docs}

- Write documentation comments directly in `.mli` and key `.ml` files using the
  odoc form `(** ... *)`.
- Run `opam exec -- dune build \@doc` to generate HTML documentation; the
  resulting site lives under `_build/default/_doc/_html/index.html`.
- Add extra `.mld` pages inside `docs/` and list them in `docs/dune` to provide
  narrative content like this page.

{1 Component Guides}
