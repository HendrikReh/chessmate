{0 Query Pipeline}

The query pipeline transforms natural-language questions into ranked chess game
results by blending deterministic filters, optional vector search, and
LLM-based scoring.

{1 Stages}

- `lib/query/query_intent.ml` normalises the question, extracts keywords,
  detects ECO/opening filters, and builds rating bounds.
- `lib/query/hybrid_planner.ml` converts the plan into SQL predicates and
  optional Qdrant payload filters while supplying deterministic query vectors.
- `lib/query/hybrid_executor.ml` fetches candidate games from Postgres, merges
  vector hits (when enabled), caches rating predicates per summary, and
  accumulates weighted scores.
- `lib/query/agent_cache.ml` and `lib/query/agent_evaluator.ml` add GPT-5
  scores and explanations, backed by Redis or in-process caches.
- `lib/query/result_formatter.ml` combines metadata, heuristic scores, and
  agent annotations into CLI/API responses.

{1 Service Integration}

- The Opium service in `services/api/chessmate_api.ml` exposes `/query`, wiring
  request parsing, planning, execution, and JSON formatting together.
- The CLI command in `lib/cli/search_command.ml` posts questions to the HTTP API
  and renders tabular summaries for quick local exploration.

{1 Extending the Pipeline}

- Configure query embeddings by exporting `QUERY_EMBEDDING_API_KEY` (falls back
  to `OPENAI_API_KEY`) and optionally `QUERY_EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT`. With those set,
  `Hybrid_planner.query_vector` now calls the embeddings client and only falls
  back to the deterministic hash when the service is unavailable (warnings are
  surfaced through the executor).
- Tune hybrid scoring weights (default 75% vector / 25% keyword) in
  `Hybrid_planner.default` as you calibrate real embedding quality.
- Add metadata filters by extending `Query_intent.metadata_filter` and updating
  the plannerâ€™s conversion logic.
- Expand telemetry or cost reporting in `lib/query/agent_telemetry.ml` to match
  your observability needs.
