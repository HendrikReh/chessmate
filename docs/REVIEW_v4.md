# Chessmate Review & Improvement Plan (v4)

_Last revised: 2025-10-10 (post-v0.6.2 rate-limit release)_

Chessmate is stable enough for production-style workloads, but a handful of infrastructure gaps are blocking public deployment. This document summarises the current state, highlights outstanding issues, and provides an incremental roadmap for closing them.

---

## 1. Current Snapshot

### Completed in v0.6.2
- **API rate limiting** via token-bucket middleware (per-IP 429s, Prometheus counters).
- **Qdrant bootstrap** ensuring the target collection exists at API/worker startup.
- **Config/Docs refresh** for new rate-limit and Qdrant env vars.

### Completed in v0.6.1
- **CLI health checks** run before queries, verifying Postgres, Qdrant, Redis, and the API.
- **JSON mode** for `chessmate query` supports piping results to tools like `jq`.
- **Review roadmap refresh** consolidates planning notes and follow-up tasks.
- **SQL whitespace fix** eliminates the `DESCLIMIT` error in the default query path.

### Completed in v0.6.0
- **Database layer** migrated to typed Caqti (no more shelling out to `psql`, parameterised queries throughout).
- **Embedding worker** uploads vectors to Qdrant with exponential backoff and metadata enrichment.
- **Secret sanitisation** redacts API keys, Postgres/Redis URLs, and other sensitive strings in logs.
- **Observability foundations**: `/metrics` exposes Caqti pool gauges; load-test script and documentation updated; sanitiser tests and core integration tests in place.

### Major Gaps
| Priority | Issue | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🔴 Critical | No API rate limiting | Abuse can exhaust quotas and starve the DB |
| 🔴 Critical | Qdrant collection bootstrap missing | Fresh deployments fail until manually created |
| 🟡 High | Sparse metrics | No request latency, error rates, or cache visibility |
| 🟡 High | Shallow health checks | Current `/health` endpoint doesn’t verify dependencies |
| 🟡 High | Agent evaluation timeout missing | Long-running calls can wedge the request path |
| 🟡 High | Query pagination absent | Large responses risk OOM |

## 2. Suggested Roadmap

### Phase 1 – Critical Fixes
1. **API rate limiting**  
   - Implementation
     - Add `lib/api/rate_limiter.(ml|mli)` encapsulating a token-bucket algorithm (per IP, configurable via `CHESSMATE_RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`, default 60/min).  
     - Expose middleware for Opium that tracks requests by remote address, decrements tokens, and returns HTTP 429 with a `Retry-After` header when the quota is exceeded.
     - Instrument a Prometheus counter (`api_rate_limited_total{ip}`) and add aggregate metrics (total limited requests, current bucket sizes) under `/metrics`.
   - Integration
     - Register the middleware around `query_handler` in `services/api/chessmate_api.ml`.  
     - Extend `Config.Api` to parse `CHESSMATE_RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE` and optional `CHESSMATE_RATE_LIMIT_BUCKET_SIZE` (burst capacity).  
     - Update `docs/openapi.yaml` with a 429 error schema and mention rate limiting in `docs/OPERATIONS.md` (tuning guidance, dashboards).
   - Testing
     - Unit tests for the token bucket (refill timing, burst handling, concurrency safety).  
     - Integration test hitting the API via cohttp, ensuring the N+1 request returns 429 and respects `Retry-After`.  
     - Load test scenario validating that legitimate traffic under the limit stays unaffected.
   - Effort: ~12h.

2. **Qdrant collection bootstrap**  
   - Implementation
     - Extend `lib/storage/repo_qdrant.(ml|mli)` with helpers to `GET` collection metadata and `PUT` a create request when the collection is missing.  
     - Define collection parameters via new env vars: `QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME` (default `positions`), `QDRANT_VECTOR_SIZE` (default 1536 for text-embedding-3-small), `QDRANT_DISTANCE` (default `Cosine`).  
     - Populate a payload schema for core fields (`game_id`, `fen`, `white`, `black`, `opening_slug`) to ensure consistent types.
   - Integration
     - On API startup (after config load, before binding the port) call `Repo_qdrant.ensure_collection`, logging results and aborting on failure.  
     - Perform the same check in the embedding worker before entering the polling loop.  
     - Add retry/backoff logic so transient Qdrant outages don’t crash the service (reuse existing Retry module).  
     - Document bootstrap behaviour in `docs/OPERATIONS.md` (including manual override command) and expose a `/health` indicator once the collection exists.
   - Testing
     - Unit/integration test that drops the collection, runs `ensure_collection`, and verifies the schema.  
     - Idempotency test: second invocation should be a no-op.  
     - Failure-path test (mock Qdrant returning 500) to ensure errors propagate clearly.  
   - Effort: ~10h.

### Phase 2 – High Priority
3. **Prometheus metrics (v0.6.x)**  
   - Instrument request latency, error rates, agent cache hits/misses, embedding throughput.  
   - Adopt a metrics helper module to keep instrumentation consistent.  
   - Effort: ~14h.

4. **Deep health checks**  
   - Implementation
     - Introduce `lib/api/health.(ml|mli)` providing probe helpers for Postgres, Qdrant (`/healthz`), Redis (`PING`), and a lightweight OpenAI sanity call (or cached token check).  
     - Return structured JSON from `/health` (e.g., `{ status: "degraded", details: { qdrant: { ok: false, error: ... } } }`).  
     - Capture probe latency and export gauges/counters via `/metrics` (e.g., `health_dependency_status{service="qdrant"}`), enabling alerting.  
   - Integration
     - Extend API startup to register the new health routes and reuse the same module inside the CLI health helper to keep logic consistent.  
     - Expose a simple `/health` endpoint for the embedding worker (either HTTP or CLI command) reusing the same probe functions.  
     - Emit degraded-mode logs with remediation hints (e.g., `vector search unavailable - check Qdrant`).  
   - Testing
     - Unit tests covering success/failure branches of each probe (mocked Postgres/Qdrant/Redis/OpenAI).  
     - Integration test verifying the JSON structure and metrics after forcing a dependency down (e.g., simulate 500 or timeout).  
     - Hook health checks into the load-test script to ensure alerts trigger under failure.  
   - Effort: ~8h.

5. **Agent evaluation timeout**  
   - Implementation
     - Add configurable timeout (`AGENT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`) to `Agents_gpt5_client`; wrap Lwt HTTP calls with `Lwt_unix.with_timeout`.  
     - Introduce a simple circuit breaker: after N consecutive timeouts, temporarily disable agent calls and log a warning, resuming after a cool-off period.  
     - Ensure fallback path returns heuristic results with a warning in the JSON payload/CLI output (`"agent": {"status": "timeout"}`) and increments a timeout counter in `/metrics`.  
   - Integration
     - Surface timeout configuration in `Config.Api`, document it in developer/operations guides, and make CLI health output indicate when the agent path is degraded.  
     - Optionally add a Redis flag to short-circuit known-bad states until the circuit breaker resets.  
   - Testing
     - Unit test forcing the HTTP layer to hang and verifying the timeout triggers and fallback rolls back to heuristic ranking.  
     - End-to-end test validating the warning and metric increments when the agent is slow.  
     - Load test scenario ensuring the circuit breaker prevents cascading failures.  
   - Effort: ~6h.

6. **Query pagination**  
   - Add `limit`/`offset` parameters to SQL and API schema.  
   - Preserve default limit of 50; add CLI flags.  
   - Effort: ~12h.

### Phase 3 – Medium Priority (v0.7+)
- Enhanced load-test harness with automated thresholds.
- Snapshot/version embedding collection (support reindexing).
- Workflow to reingest/repair orphaned vectors.
- CLI telemetry improvements (structured JSON logs, tracing IDs).
- Sandbox toggle for simulated agent results (useful for demos).

## 3. Outstanding Investments

| Priority | Tasks | Est. Hours |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Critical | 2 | 20–24 |
| High | 4 | 40–50 |
| Medium | 6 | 45–60 |
| Low | 4 | 24–32 |
| **Total** | **16** | **129–166** |

The aim is to close out the critical items before widening API access. Most remaining work is infrastructure-focused; domain logic (parsers, embeddings, agent scoring) is in good shape.
